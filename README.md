For the problem statement given, here is the approach I followed.

First I find the roots i.e., for each x , using base and value I found y and I find only k roots, because those are enough to find the constant.
I have created a matrix, where the matrix stores the values of all the powers till k, for each x.

with constants and matrix, I have tried to find the constant using Gaussian elimination method.
